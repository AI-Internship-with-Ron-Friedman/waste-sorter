# Waste-Sorter

This was my first attempt at building an image classifier. I used the fastai library in Python to sort different types of trash. The test accuracy higher than I expected it to be (92%), which goes to show that anybody can really do this. Oh, I also wrote a quick [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-an-image-classifier-for-waste-sorting-6d11d3c9c478) explaining the process.

All the code for this project is in Waste sorter.ipynb. 

## How to view this project

The notebook is too big to render on Github, which is why we have to use Jupyter Notebook Viewer to render it. Start with option (a) and if the link doesn't work, use option (b).

### Option (a) 

- Click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/collindching/Waste-Sorter/blob/master/Waste%20sorter.ipynb)

### Option (b)

1. Copy the link to the notebook on Github (https://github.com/collindching/Waste-Sorter/blob/master/Waste%20sorter.ipynb)

2. Follow this link [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and paste the notebook URL to view the notebook

## How to run this notebook

1. Download Waste sorter.ipynb

2. Download the corresponding dataset [here](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet/blob/master/data/dataset-resized.zip) and move it to the same directory as the notebook

3. Run the notebook in Anaconda
